# DDP-on-Trajectory-Optimization

This is an assignment on the NUS Module CS6244, 2017 Fall. It is to replicate the algorithm from the conference paper. The Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) is used to plan the motion for the autonomous unman vehicle. The non-linear plant system in my code is slightly different from the one in the paper. I use a 6th order system to consider both the kinematics.and dynamics of the vehicle while the paper uses only a 4th order one with the kinematics.

##### Run optimizer to plan a route for the vehicle with 0 initial state.

##### Run veloPlot to see a comparison of output trajectories with different initial velocities.

##### Run orienPlot to see a comparison of output trajectories with different initial orientations.
